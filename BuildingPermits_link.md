Where I got the sample data
===========================

[https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ydr8-5enu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ydr8-5enu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) is the URL I downloaded from but I am not sure if the link address is stable (What is that ydr8-5enu part? Some tracking part of the URL?)

I got the data from [The Chicago Data Portal](
https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?page=1&utf8=?&view_type=rich) and
clicking on the words "Building Permits" which is the name of a data set.  This
is currently the third most popular data set available.  The data set is
downloaded from the "CSV" link in the "Download" section on the right of [the
building permits
page](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu).  To
get to the Download section you will need to click on the blue "Export" button
(top right) to get the Export menu section to show.  The "Downloads" menu did
not appear for me immediately.  Open one of the menu titles that does show and
the Download menu title appears at the bottom of the Export section.  Open the
Download menu to find the CSV link. Click on it and your browser should then
download the data.
